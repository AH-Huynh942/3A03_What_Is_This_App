\section{Overall Product Description}
\label{sec:overall_description}
% Begin Section

\begin{itemize}
	\item This section should describe the general factors that affect the product and its requirements. 
	\item It does not state specific requirements.
	\item It provides a \emph{background} for those requirements and makes them easier to understand.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Product Perspective}
\label{sub:product_perspective}
% Begin SubSection
\begin{itemize}
	\item Put the product into perspective with other related products, i.e., context
	\item If the product is independent and totally self-contained, it should be stated here
	\item If the SRS defines a product that is a component of a larger system, then this subsection should relate the requirements of that larger system to the functionality of the software being developed. Identify interfaces between that larger system and the software to be developed.
	\item A block diagram showing the major components of the larger system, interconnections, and external interfaces can be helpful
\end{itemize}
% End SubSection

\subsection{Product Functions}
\label{sub:product_functions}
% Begin SubSection
\begin{itemize}
	\item Provide a \emph{summary} of the major functions that the software will perform.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Example}: An SRS for an accounting program may use this part to address customer account maintenance, customer statement, and invoice preparation without mentioning the vast amount of detail that each of those functions requires.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Functions should be organized in a way that makes the list of functions understandable to the customer or to anyone else reading the document for the first time 
	\item Present the functions in a list format - each item should be one function, with a brief description of it
	\item Textual or graphical methods can be used to show the different functions and their relationships
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Such a diagram is not intended to show a design of a product, but simply shows the logical relationships among variables
	\end{itemize} 
\end{itemize}
% End SubSection

\subsection{User Characteristics}
\label{sub:user_characteristics}
% Begin SubSection
\begin{itemize}
	\item Describe those general characteristics of the intended users of the product including educational level, experience, and technical expertise 
	\item Since there will be many users, you may wish to divide into different user types or personas
%	\item Do not state specific requirements, but rather provide the reasons why certain specific requirements are later specified
\end{itemize}
% End SubSection

\subsection{Constraints}
\label{sub:constraints}
% Begin SubSection
\begin{itemize}
	\item Provide a general description of any constraints that will limit the developer's options
\end{itemize}
% End SubSection

\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
\label{sub:assumptions_and_dependencies}
% Begin SubSection
\begin{itemize}
	\item List any assumptions you made in interpreting what the software being developed is aiming to achieve
	\item List any other assumptions you made that, if it fails to hold, could require you to change the requirements
	%\item List each of the factors that affect the requirements stated in the SRS
	%\item These factors are not design constraints on the software but are, rather, any changes to them that can affect the requirements in the SRS
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Example}: An assumption may be that a specific operating system will be available on the hardware designated for the software product. If, in fact, the operating system is not available, the SRS would then have to change accordingly.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
% End SubSection

\subsection{Apportioning of Requirements}
\label{sub:apportioning_of_requirements}
% Begin SubSection
\begin{itemize}
	\item Identify requirements that may be delayed until future versions of the system
\end{itemize}
% End SubSection
