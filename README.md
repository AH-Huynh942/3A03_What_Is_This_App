# 3A03_What_Is_This_App 

With the advent of mobile operating systems, such as Android and iOS the de-
velopment of software applications for mobile devices has become increasingly 
popular. The aim of this project is to specify, design, and implement an appli-
cation for a mobile device, in particular, one based on the Android platform.

### 1 Project Outline
Whenever something unknown is found or observed, one of the immediate ques-
tions is “What is this?”. To answer this question requires the help of several 
experts and tests based on input.

You and your development team have been contracted to specify, design, and 
implement a system modeling application that allows a user to input specific 
characteristics that your application will use to identify what the object or phe-
nomenon is. The specifics of what kind of objects or phenomenons you identify 
is up to your team, but must first be approved by the Teaching Assistants.

1. The application must implement at least three experts which are consulted
for the identification.
2. Each expert must be separate from another and easily swappable.
3. If the expertise of the expert allows it, they must answer.
4. There must be a centralized “Forum” which the experts report their an-
swer.
5. If various conflicting answers are reported, the “Forum” must resolve the
conflict.
6. The “Forum” must report an answer.
7. All recorded answers must be stored, along with a report of if the item
was correctly identified by the user.

*Note* The implementation of the requirements listed above constitutes the 
minimum requirements for project completeness. Any additional functionality 
will be rewarded. Each team is required to implement at least one addi-
tional innovative feature not mentioned in the outline. Creativity will be 
generously rewarded.

### 2 Technology
The Android Software Development Kit (SDK) is natively written in Java. How-
ever, there exists the Scripting Layer for Android (SL4A) which allows you to 
develop your android applications in scripting languages such as Python.

You are free to use Java, Python, or another scripting language supported by 
SL4A, as long as it meets the specified requirements. However, we are better 
equipped to provide you technical support with Java. The Android Software 
Development Kit (SDK) is natively written in Java.

### 3 Tools
The Android SDK has the tools, sample code, and documentation you will 
need to create applications.

The Android SDK is available at:http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html

If you plan to implement your application using Python, you will need the 
Scripting Layer for Android (SL4A). SL4A provides interactive interpreters, 
script editing, and script execution for various scripting languages. SL4A is 
available at: https://github.com/damonkohler/sl4a.

You are free to use any software design tool, i.e., StarUML, Visio, etc. and any 
version management tool, i.e., SVN, Google Code, SF.net, etc., as long as it 
meets the project requirements.

### 4 Resources
*Note* A large portion of this project is to do the required background re-
search on working with the Android platform and information security. Keep 
in mind that a substantial component of any software project is to solve and/or 
eliminate the underlying technical difficulties. This often means hitting manuals 
and Google. To start you off, we provide a narrow selection of references and 
resources.

### 4.1 Android, Java, and Python
There are numerous online resources, including code samples, tutorials, screen-
casts, etc. to help you get started with the development of your Android Ap-
plication.

For those of you wishing to implement your application in Java, a good reference 
is the following:
1. Sue Smith. Learn Android SDK From Scratch. Tuts+. 2013. Available: 
http://code.tutsplus.com/series/learn-android-sdk-from-scratch–mobile-21677.
• This is a 17 part series of tutorials to help you get started with the 
Android SDK with a particular focus on programming with Java.
For those of you wishing to script your application in Python, some good refer-
ences are:
1. Paul Ferrill. Pro Android Python with SL4A. APress. 2011.
• This book is available free online in PDF form.
2. Paul Barry. Python for Android. Linux Journal. 2011. Available:
http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/10940.
• This is a good beginners tutorial to help install the Android SDK, 
SL4A, and how to configure things to get them to work. The tutorial 
is written for Linux but can easily be used for Windows and Mac OS 
X as well.
For general reference, the Android Developers site is a good place to look: 
http://developer.android.com/index.html.

### 5 Deliverables
Every team will submit one team copy of each of the following deliverables at 
the beginning of lecture on the specified due date with the exception of D4 which 
will be due during the scheduled time for the project demonstration. Each de-
liverable must have a list of the contributions of each team member and must 
be signed and agreed by each team member.

*Note* The due dates may be adjusted by the instructor as circumstances 
dictate.

D1: Requirements Specification (10%) - Feb 9, 2025
D2: High Level Architectural Design (10%) - Mar 9, 2025
D3: Detailed Design (10%) - Mar 30, 2025
D5: Final Code (10%) - Apr 6, 2025

*Note* The project described in each deliverable may be a subset of the project 
described in the previous deliverable. You may cut features as you progress 
through the semester. This idea is illustrated in the inverted trapezoid dia-
gram. However, the final implementation must contain at least the minimum 
project requirements as specified above, plus one additional innovative 
feature of your own design. Creativity and additional effort will be rewarded, 
so think big at the beginning and keep your options open as long as possible.

### 6 Log Books
Each team member is expected to keep a hand-written log book that contains 
all the notes of the work done during the team meetings and your individual 
contributions to the project done on your own time. Log books will be randomly 
requested to evaluate a student’s participation during the course of the project, 
and may be used as a resource in the event of a dispute within a group. Be 
sure to bring your log book to all tutorial sessions. Remember that the log 
book must be a physical book. The logbook will be handed in at the end of the 
semester as a major reference to evaluate your contribution to the group.

# MARKING

Please direct all marking-related questions to Lindsay. 

General Marking Information:
• Marking is done in a 'big picture' way - this means the focus is on providing 
feedback. 
• The mark at the end is a global assessment of the quality of work; it’s not broken 
down by x points for this, y points for that.  
• Writing matters – make sure it’s clear and easy to read for a non-technical 
audience. 
• If you're still panicking about marking, you can always send me (Lindsay) what you 
have for feedback before the due date. (But if you do this last minute, you may not 
get a reply in time. It’s better to send a sample of what you’re unsure about earlier 
on).

Writing Style:
• Understandability - make sure to clearly explain your reasoning behind things, 
don’t just give the final result. 
• Organization - you have a template, so this is more the organization of your writing
within it. Make sure your thoughts are well-organized and flow well. Don't jump 
around between unrelated ideas or go in circles.
• Readability - it should be well-written and easy to read for a non-technical 
audience.
• Spelling/Grammar – these are important in a professional document. The company
is deciding whether they will hire you to create software for them. If you can’t 
catch your spelling/grammar errors, they might question whether you can catch 
your programming errors.
• Concise & Precise – make sure you put in enough detail to explain everything, but 
don’t go overboard.

#### Deliverable 1 - Marking Information:
• Deliverable 1 is out of 10 - 7 marks for the main part, 3 marks for the 
creative/innovative feature.
• There are no hidden expectations (like a fixed # of requirements) that we’re 
expecting. (Focus on quality, not quantity.)
• Include the reasoning behind each requirement with a “Rationale:...” below each.
• Follow the template. 
• The audience is the Taxi Company, so don’t assume any software knowledge of the
reader.
• Make sure you cover everything in the project description, as stated.

#### Deliverable 2 - Marking Information:
• Deliverable 2 is out of 10 
• Follow the template. 
• Make sure you cover everything in the project description, as stated.
